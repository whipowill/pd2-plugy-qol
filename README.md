# Project Diablo 2

The best way to play the game.

This repo includes my files for playing the game using PlugY w/ some minor game tweaks.

## Mods

- Moved Deckard Cain in Act 5

This repo includes a mods [folder](https://github.com/whipowill/pd2-plugy-qol/tree/master/Mods) w/ some optional TXT file changes sorted by season.  These changes usually involve minor tweaks, such as Countess always droping 3 runes and Cube enabling rune downgrades.  You would have to copy/paste these files into ``data/global/excel/`` to use them.

To my knowledge, there are no DLL mods that work other than PlugY.  This sadly excludes the legendary [BaseMod](https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65492).  Some additional notes:

- In PlugY, you must have shared gold disabled as it conflicts with PD2
- In PlugY, the ``EnabledTXTFilesWhenMSExcelOpenIt`` option doesn't seem to work

See the PD2 wiki [bugs](https://projectdiablo2.miraheze.org/wiki/Bugs) page to read more.

## Loot Filter

This repo includes my custom loot filter ported over from [SlashDiablo](https://slashdiablo.net/).

See the PD2 wiki loot filter [rules](https://projectdiablo2.miraheze.org/wiki/Item_Filtering) page to read more.
