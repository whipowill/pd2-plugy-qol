# Project Diablo 2

The best way to play the game.

This repo includes my files for playing the game using PlugY w/ some minor game tweaks.

**Updated to Season 8.**

## Soft Mods

Included in this repo are some TXT file changes I've tinkered with, sorted by season.  These changes usually involve minor tweaks, such as Countess always droping 3 runes and Cube enabling rune downgrades.

## Hard Mods

To my knowledge, there are no mods that work other than PlugY, which excludes the legendary [BaseMod](https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65492).

- In PlugY, you must have shared gold disabled as it conflicts with PD2
- In PlugY, the ``EnabledTXTFilesWhenMSExcelOpenIt`` option doesn't seem to work

See the wiki [bugs](https://projectdiablo2.miraheze.org/wiki/Bugs) page to read more.

## Loot Filter

Includes my custom loot filter I ported over from [SlashDiablo](https://slashdiablo.net/).
