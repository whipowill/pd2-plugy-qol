# Project Diablo 2

The best way to play the game.

This repo includes my files for playing the game using PlugY w/ some minor game tweaks.

**Updated to Season 8.**

## Changes

Right now I'm playing w/ minor changes to the game files to make SP more enjoyable.

- Drops
	- Countess always drops 3 runes
		- Normal up to Lem
		- Nightmare up to Vex
		- Hell up to Cham
- Cube
	- Upgrade 2 runes -> 1 higher rank rune
	- Downgrade rune -> 2 lower rank runes
	- Upgrade 3 gems -> 1 higher rank gem
	- Downgrade gem -> 3 lower rank gems
	- Use a key w/ a socketed item and get the runes back

My plan is to extract the game files and make these edits every season.

## Loot Filter

Includes my custom loot filter I ported over from [SlashDiablo](https://slashdiablo.net/).

## Notes

To my knowledge, there are no mods that can work with PD2 other than PlugY, which excludes the legendary [BaseMod](https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65492).

- In PlugY, you must have shared gold disabled as it conflicts with PD2
- In PlugY, the ``EnabledTXTFilesWhenMSExcelOpenIt`` option doesn't seem to work
